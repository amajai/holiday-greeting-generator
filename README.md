An Artificial Intelligence (AI) text generation application that lets you generate personalized holiday greetings for various occasions! Whether it's Christmas, New Year, Eid, or any other special day, this app is here to help you spread joy and warmth with customized greetings. It is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) called Zephyr-7B-β.

## Overview
The App leverages Zephyr-7B-β, a fine-tuned model in the Zephyr series, designed to act as a helpful assistant. Trained on a mix of publicly available and synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), this language model brings a touch of personalization to your holiday greetings.

## Features
1. Holiday Selection: Choose from a variety of holidays, occasions, special days/weeks/months to tailor your greeting.
1. Optional Inputs: Personalize your greeting further by providing optional details:
      - Receiver Name - The name of the person to whom the holiday greeting is addressed.
      - Receiver Location - The location or place where the receiver is currently situated.
      - Sentiments - The emotional tone or feelings expressed in the greeting, such as joyous, warm, or celebratory.
      - Relation - The nature of the relationship between the sender and the receiver (e.g., friend, family, colleague).
      - Greeting Type - The style or formality of the greeting, whether it's formal, casual, or personalized.
      - Keywords - Specific words or phrases to be incorporated into the greeting for added personalization or thematic relevance.
1. Button to easily copy generated text: with one click, you can copy the generated greeting.
